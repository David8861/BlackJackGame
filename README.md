# BlackJackGame
### Experience one of my favorite card games to date!

#### BlackJack is a numbers game, perfect for testing conditionals and random functions.
In short, the computer reveals half of it's hand, while the player is given both cards up front.
To generate random numbers, we need to call a method Random() with a value from 1 to 13.
##### I'm currently working on implementing suits(Aces, Spades, etc..) as well as Kings, Queens, Jacks etc..
